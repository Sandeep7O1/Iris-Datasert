**Iris Dataset Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors**
This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the samples into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

üìÅ **Repository Contents**
      Iris.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

üîç **Project Overview**
      The notebook follows these main steps:
        **Data Loading**: The Iris dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's built-in datasets.
        **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
        **Model Training:** A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is trained on the training data.
        **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test data, and performance metrics are computed.
        **Visualization:** A confusion matrix is plotted using seaborn to visualize the model's performance.
